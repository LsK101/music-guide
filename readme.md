Music Guide allows you to search your favorite artists and songs and find song lyrics,
videos, upcoming shows, and similar artists. It allows you to discover new things
about them and discover new artists who sound similar that you may have never heard
of before.

The app is fully responsive and works in mobile (portrait/landscape) and in desktop,
and is made possible strictly with HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery.
